      <h2>Welcome to <strong>CLC</strong>.</h2>
      <p class="10u -1u">
        We are a Northwestern student-led group created to informally connect students who speak foreign languages.  We are committed to improving students' speaking and overall proficiency in their foreign language(s) while promoting cross-cultural understanding and friendships through informal conversational practice.  Proficiency in multiple languages allows communication among people from a variety of cultures and makes one more attractive to potential employers.   We aim to expand your second language proficiency in a casual, stress-free environment, allowing you to make new friends in the process.

            Hi!  My name is Kate and I am the President and Founder of CLC.  I am currently a senior Linguistics major at Northwestern University.  I love to travel and have studied abroad in Valencia, Spain, Freiburg, Germany, and Edinburgh, Scotland.  This idea came to me during my sophomore year of college and grew and expanded during my junior year abroad.  As a speaker of Spanish, German, and Arabic, I always wanted a way to practice my languages on campus, since speaking and comprehension skills are some of the hardest to master.  I hope that this organization creates a community of language enthusiasts and helps you enhance your speaking skills and cross-cultural understanding.
