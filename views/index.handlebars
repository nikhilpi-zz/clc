            Hi!  My name is Kate and I am the President and Founder of CLC.  I am currently a senior Linguistics major at Northwestern University.  I love to travel and have studied abroad in Valencia, Spain, Freiburg, Germany, and Edinburgh, Scotland.  This idea came to me during my sophomore year of college and grew and expanded during my junior year abroad.  As a speaker of Spanish, German, and Arabic, I always wanted a way to practice my languages on campus, since speaking and comprehension skills are some of the hardest to master.  I hope that this organization creates a community of language enthusiasts and helps you enhance your speaking skills and cross-cultural understanding.
