              DesignWorks pairs the client with a carefully chosen designer that best fits the clients design needs. Designer makes initial design based on client specifications and puts it on <a href="http://www.invisionapp.com/" target="_blank">InVision</a> by agreed upon due date.

              <h3>3. The Revision Round</h3>
            </header>
            <p>
              The client will have two business days to provide feedback and to communicate with designer over InVision. This feedback will be incorporated within three business days and the client will be able to view the final product (watermarked) on InVision. If the client would like further rounds of revision they can follow the same procedure as before but will incur an additional revision fee.
